It includes key metrics such as average debt, rate of change, percent change, and debt trajectory over time. Economic events are annotated on the timeline. The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to explore the data by administration and year. The data is sourced from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n### Panel 1 -- Average Debt (USD) by administration:\n\n* Debt levels steadily increase over time, regardless of party.\n\n* Democratic administrations (blue bars) and Republican administrations (solid red) both show growth.\n\n* Trump's second term (2025–2028) is represented with a striped red bar, indicating a projected administration.\n\n* The highest average debt is seen during the projected Trump (2nd Term), reflecting cumulative debt and continued fiscal expansion.\n\n### Panel 2 -- Average Debt Slope (Rate of Change in Debt)\n\n* This shows the average annual increase in total debt for each administration.\n\n* The slope generally increases from Clinton through Trump (1st Term).\n\n* A steep increase under Biden, indicating high borrowing during the COVID recovery period.\n\n* A sharp drop in slope for Trump (2nd Term), likely due to limited available data (only 2025 included so far).\n\n### Panel 3 -- Average Debt Percent Change (%)\n\n* Shows relative year-over-year growth in debt.\n\n* High percent change under Obama (1st Term) and Trump (1st Term) due to post-recession and pandemic spending.\n\n* The percentage declines in recent years, as the debt base becomes much larger.\n\n* The Trump (2nd Term) bar drops to 0% — this reflects only one data point (2025) being available so far.\n\n### Panel 4 -- Debt Trajectory Over Time (1993 - 2025)\n\n* The debt curve is exponential, accelerating particularly after:\n\n    > 2008 (Great Recession)\n\n    > 2020 (COVID-19 Pandemic)\n\n* Vertical dashed lines mark major economic events:\n\n    > 📉 2001: Dot-com Bust\n\n    > 💥 2008: Great Recession\n\n    > ⚠️ 2011: Debt Ceiling Crisis\n\n    > 🦠 2020: COVID-19\n\nThere is no sign of debt deceleration — even as crises resolve, debt continues to rise.\n\n\n## Key Takeaways: \n\n* National debt is not strictly tied to political party, but economic events (recessions, crises) are major inflection points.\n\n* The Trump (2nd Term) projection highlights the need for caution when interpreting future metrics based on partial-year data.\n\n* Long-term debt growth has outpaced GDP growth in many years, signaling potential sustainability challenges.\n\n# Historical Perspective:\n\nThis chart shows the gross federal debt as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 1940 through the early 2020s. The ratio captures how much the federal government owes relative to the size of the economy.\n\n![Sources: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; U.S. Office of Management and Budget via FRED®](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1FKXK&height=490)\n\n### Major Events:\n\n#### 1940s WWII Debt Surge:\n\n* Event: World War II\n* Effect: Debt-to-GDP skyrocketed, peaking around 120% by 1945 as the U.S. massively borrowed to finance the war effort.\n* Context: The economy was mobilized for war, with spending far exceeding tax revenues. GDP also grew quickly toward the war’s end, helping to stabilize the ratio.\n\n#### 1950s - 1970s - Postwar Recovery and Growth:\n\n* Trend: Steady decline in debt-to-GDP, falling to ~30% by 1980\n* Why: Strong economic growth (the postwar boom), controlled spending, and higher taxes helped reduce the relative debt burden.\n* Key Policies: GI Bill, strong labor unions, progressive taxation, and New Deal-era safety nets.\n\n#### 1980s Reganomics and Rising Debt\n\n* Event: Large tax cuts, increased military spending, and recession.\n* Effect: Debt-to_GDP began to rise again after bottoming out in the late 1970s\n* Notable: First major increase outside of war time. The deficit become a political issue again.\n\n#### 1990s Fiscal Restraint and the Clinton Surplus\n\n* Trend: Slight decline in the debt ratio\n* Why: Economic expansion, spending discipline, and 1993 Tax increases led to budget surpluses in the late 1990s\n* Highlight: Debt-to-GDP stabilied and even declined briefly. \n\n#### 2000s - Wars and Financial Crisis\n\nEvents:\n    * Bush Era tax cuts (2001,2003)\n    * Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\n    * 2008 Global Financial Crisis\n    * Effect: Shapre rise in debt-to-GDP starting around 2008\n\n#### 2010s - 2020s -- Pandemic and Historic Spending\n\n* Event: Covid-19 Pandemic\n* Effect: Spiked debt-to-GDP to over 120% matching WWII levels\n* Why: Trillions in emergency stimulus + a sudden drop in GDP during lockdowns \n\n#### Post-Covid Stabilization\n\n* Recent trend: Slight decrease after the 2020 peak, as GDP recovered and emergency spending declined\n* Still High: Dept-to-GDP remains historically elevated above 110%\n\n```{python}\n# Re-import libraries after code state reset\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n# Manually recreate key data points from the FRED debt-to-GDP chart for illustration\ndata = {\n    \"year\": [1940, 1945, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, 2023],\n    \"debt_to_gdp\": [45, 119, 94, 55, 35, 31, 55, 58, 90, 129, 120]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Define major events to annotate\nevents = [\n    {\"year\": 1945, \"label\": \"WWII Peak\"},\n    {\"year\": 1982, \"label\": \"Reagan Tax Cuts\"},\n    {\"year\": 2001, \"label\": \"Bush Tax Cuts\"},\n    {\"year\": 2008, \"label\": \"Financial Crisis\"},\n    {\"year\": 2020, \"label\": \"COVID-19\"},\n]\n\n# Create the figure\nfig = go.Figure()\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x=df[\"year\"],\n    y=df[\"debt_to_gdp\"],\n    mode=\"lines+markers\",\n    name=\"Debt-to-GDP Ratio\",\n    line=dict(color=\"royalblue\", width=3)\n))\n\n# Add vertical lines and annotations\nfor event in events:\n    fig.add_vline(x=event[\"year\"], line_width=1, line_dash=\"dot\", line_color=\"gray\")\n    fig.add_annotation(\n        x=event[\"year\"],\n        y=max(df[\"debt_to_gdp\"]) * 1.05,\n        text=event[\"label\"],\n        showarrow=False,\n        textangle=-90,\n        font=dict(size=10, color=\"gray\"),\n        xanchor=\"left\"\n    )\n\n# Update layout\nfig.update_layout(\n    title=\"U.S. Gross Federal Debt as a Percent of GDP (1940–2023)\",\n    xaxis_title=\"Year\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Debt-to-GDP (%)\",\n    yaxis_range=[0, max(df[\"debt_to_gdp\"]) * 1.2],\n    hovermode=\"x unified\",\n    template=\"plotly_white\",\n    height=600,\n    width=1000\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n```","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{python}\nfrom national_debt_analysis import fetch_debt_data, calculate_debt_metrics, plot_debt_dashboard\n\ndf = fetch_debt_data()\nyear_end_debt, admin_summary, colors, patterns = calculate_debt_metrics(df)\nplot_debt_dashboard(year_end_debt, admin_summary, colors, patterns)\n```\n\n## Explanation: \n\nThis dashboard visualizes the evolution of the U.S. national debt across presidential administrations from 1993 through 2025.
